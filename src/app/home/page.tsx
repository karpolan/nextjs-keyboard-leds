          Many models of modern notebooks, netbooks and cordless keyboards have no indicators for Caps Lock, and Num
          Lock. Indicator of Scroll lock disappeared almost from any hardware. <strong>Keyboard LEDs</strong> software
          solves this problem and allows you to see the current state of keyboard locks on small icon in the system tray
          or on the floating window over your screen.
